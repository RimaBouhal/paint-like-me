### ðŸŽ¨ Paint Like Me
Paint Like Me is an implementation of [Painterly Rendering with Curved Brush Strokes of Multiple Sizes (Hertzmann)](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/publications/painterly98/hertzmann-siggraph98.pdf)

Every artist has their own style, some of which became the basis of entire art movements. In painting, especially for oil and acrylic, style is a function of brush strokes. In this project, I chose to recreate some popular art styles by implementing different kinds of brush strokes, turning any photo into a work of art.
