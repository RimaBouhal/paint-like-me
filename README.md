# ðŸŽ¨ Paint Like Me
Paint Like Me is an implementation of [Painterly Rendering with Curved Brush Strokes of Multiple Sizes (Hertzmann)](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/publications/painterly98/hertzmann-siggraph98.pdf)

Every artist has their own style, some of which became the basis of entire art movements. In painting, especially for oil and acrylic, style is a function of brush strokes. In this project, I chose to recreate some popular art styles by implementing different kinds of brush strokes, turning any photo into a work of art.

### Requirements
- python 3.8
- numpy 1.21.4
- opencv-python 4.5.60
- matplotlib 3.3.4
- scipy 1.6.0
- [pycairo](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 1.16.2

To run my project, open up the notebook PainterlyRendering.ipynb, run the cells in order from top to bottom.

(top cells implement Hertzmann's method)
